## Approach and Decisions

**Modular Backend:**  
Used modular MVC pattern to separate controllers, services, and repositories for better maintainability and scalability.

**Prisma ORM:**  
Selected Prisma for its type safety, schema migrations, and simple querying syntax.

**Authentication:**  
Implemented JWT-based authentication with role-based protected routes (user-specific data isolation).

**Form Validation:**  
Used Zod on both client and server side to ensure consistent and reliable validation.

**UI/UX:**  
Designed a simple, clean, responsive UI using TailwindCSS with dark mode support.

**API Security:**  
All routes protected by JWT middleware and user-specific data access enforced at the database query level.

**Frontend State:**  
Managed form states and API interactions efficiently with React Hook Form and Axios.

**Responsiveness:**  
Built mobile-first, ensuring a consistent experience across all screen sizes.
